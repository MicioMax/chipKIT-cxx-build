INTRODUCTION
 
This project contains a BASH build script for the chipKIT Compiler for Microchip 
Technology's PIC32 MCUs. The compiler is packaged with the chipKIT MPIDE, hosted at 
<https://github.com/chipKIT32/chipKIT32-MAX>.

*** This script is designed to run on Mac OS X 10.6 or 10.7. It should also run under 
Linux, but it won't build the Mac version when run under Linux. ***

It builds compilers for Mac OS X (Darwin), 32-bit Linux, and 32-bit Microsoft Windows 
(minGW32).


PREREQUISITES:

1) Apple Xcode with GCC 4.2 and the Mac OS X 10.5 SDK.
2) Linux 32-bit cross compiler (gcc 4.5.2, glibc 2.11.1) 
   <http://crossgcc.rts-software.org/doku.php>
3) MinGW32 4.3.0 <http://crossgcc.rts-software.org/doku.php>
4) Other tools: rsync, curl, find, which, tar

Once you've installed all of the compilers and tools listed above, make sure that they 
are in your system path. You should be able to run 'which' in a terminal window to verify
that they can be called.

  $ which g++-4.2
  /usr/bin/g++-4.2
  $ which i586-pc-linux-g++
  /usr/local/gcc-4.5.2-for-linux32/bin/i586-pc-linux-g++
  $ which i386-mingw32-gcc
  /usr/local/i386-mingw32-4.3.0/bin/i386-mingw32-gcc
  $ which find
  /usr/bin/find
  $ which rsync
  /usr/bin/rsync
  $ which curl
  /opt/local/bin/curl

Optional:
You may also wish to install growl and growl-notify so that you can more easily follow
the build status as the script runs. Growl is available in the Mac App Store and 
growl-notify is available from <http://growl.info/extras.php>.


INSTRUCTIONS

1) Download the chipKIT-cxx-build.sh BASH script from the github repository currently 
   located at <https://github.com/jasonkajita/chipKIT-cxx-build>. Place the script in a 
   new directory.
   
2) Make sure that the script has executable permissions
   $ chmod +x chipKIT-cxx-build.sh
   
3) Execute the script
   $ ./chipKIT-cxx-build.sh
   
The script should begin executing. It will create a new directory (by default named 
chipKIT-cxx-master). Next, it will download all of the necessary source code and 
begin compiling. You can track the status by opening the log file (usually named 
chipKIT-cxx-master.log).

When the script completes, the Mac, Linux, and Windows images will be located in the zips
subdirectory as bzip2 compressed tar files. You will also find the original install images
in directories named Darwin-image, Linux32-image, and win32-image.
